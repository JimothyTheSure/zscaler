<p>When you specify a <b>url_category</b>, you can give it either the name you created, or the ID which is assigned to it from Zscaler.
   The search will first search for the name, as opposed to the ID. So if you create a category <b>phantom-block</b>, you could
   use either <b>phantom-block</b> or <b>CUSTOM_**</b>. The name for these is case sensitive.
